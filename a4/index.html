          <h2>Explanation</h2>
          <p>The Lissajous Vectorscope visualizes the stereo image of a song.
              The X-Axis represents the decibel level of the right channel and the Y-axis represents the decibel level of the left channel. 
              Each point represents a different frequency in the waveform, so there are a total of 4096 dots at all times, 
              each with an x value representing the loudness in the right channel and a y representing the loudness in the left.
              A mono sound (with equivalent right and left channels) will produce a perfect diagonal line through the origin with a slope of 1.
              Fit lines with negative slope indicate phase issues, and horizontal and vertical lines represent the absence of the left and right channel respectively.
               Points are color coded by their distance, from the perfect mono line, with hotter colors representing sounds that are wider in the stereo space. 
               This can be used to visualize issues in the stereo imaging of a piece that may lead to phasing or distortion, 
               or can be used to see how specific songs fit in the soundstage of a song, to more accurately tune stereo placement of musical elements for creative effect.
               For example, in the reference track, there is a wooden block sound that is more reverberant and wide, creating a more circular pattern of warmly colored dots.
